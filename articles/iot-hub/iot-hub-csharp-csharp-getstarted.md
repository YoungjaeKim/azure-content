# Get started with Azure IoT Hub for .NET

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-get-started.md)]

## Introduction

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of internet of things (IoT) devices and a solution back end. One of the biggest challenges IoT projects face is how to reliably and securely connect devices to the solution back end. To address this challenge, IoT Hub:

- Offers reliable device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device hyper-scale messaging.
- Enables secure communications using per-device security credentials and access control.
- Includes device libraries for the most popular languages and platforms.

This tutorial shows you how to:

- Use the Azure portal to create an IoT hub.
- Create a device identity in your IoT hub.
- Create a simulated device that sends telemetry to your cloud back end, and receives commands from your cloud back end.

At the end of this tutorial you will have three Windows console applications:

* **CreateDeviceIdentity**, which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your simulated device.
* **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages**, which displays the telemetry sent by your simulated device.
* **SimulatedDevice**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and sends a telemetry message every second using the AMQPS protocol.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The article [IoT Hub SDKs][lnk-hub-sdks] provides information about the various SDKs that you can use to build both applications to run on devices and your solution back end.

To complete this tutorial you'll need the following:

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial][lnk-free-trial].

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

You have now created your IoT hub and you have the hostname and connection string you need to complete the rest of this tutorial.

## Run the applications

You are now ready to run the applications.

1.	In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, right-click your solution and then click **Set StartUp projects**. Select **Multiple startup projects**, then select **Start** as the **Action** for both the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages** and **SimulatedDevice** projects.

2.	Press **F5** to start both apps running. The console output from the **SimulatedDevice** app shows the messages your simulated device sends to your IoT hub, and the console output from the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages** app shows the messages that your IoT hub receives.

3. The **Usage** tile in the [Azure portal][lnk-portal] shows the number of messages sent to the hub:

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the portal and then created a device identity in the hub's identity registry. You used this device identity to enable the simulated device app to send device-to-cloud messages to the hub and created an app that displays the messages received by the hub. You can continue to explore IoT hub features and other IoT scenarios in the following tutorials:

- [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub][lnk-c2d-tutorial] shows how to send messages to devices, and process the delivery feedback produced by IoT Hub.
- [Process Device-to-Cloud messages][lnk-process-d2c-tutorial] shows how to reliably process telemetry and interactive messages coming from devices.
- [Uploading files from devices][lnk-upload-tutorial] describes a pattern that makes use of cloud-to-device messages to facilitate file uploads from devices.
