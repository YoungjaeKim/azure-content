# Container management with Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm provides an environment for deploying containerized workload across a pooled set of Docker hosts. Docker Swarm uses the native Docker API, and the workflow for managing containers on a Docker Swarm is almost identical to what it would be on a single container host. This document will provide simple examples of deploying containerized workload, in an Azure Container Service instance of Docker Swarm. For more in-depth documentation on Docker Swarm, see [Docker Swarm on Docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/).

Pre-requisites to the exercises in this document:

- [Create a Swarm Cluster on the Azure Container Service](./container-service-deployment.md)
- [Connect with the Swarm Cluster on the Azure Container Service](./container-service-connect.md)

## Deploy a new container

To create a new container in the Docker Swarm, use the `docker run` command. This example creates a container from the `yeasy/simple-web` image.


```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ docker run -d -p 80:80 yeasy/simple-web

4298d397b9ab6f37e2d1978ef3c8c1537c938e98a8bf096ff00def2eab04bf72
```

Once the container has been created, use `docker ps` to return information about the container. Notice here that the Swarm agent, hosting the container, is listed.


```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES
4298d397b9ab        yeasy/simple-web    "/bin/sh -c 'python i"   31 seconds ago      Up 9 seconds        10.0.0.5:80->80/tcp   swarm-agent-34A73819-1/happy_allen
```  

The application running in this container can now be accessed through the public DNS name of the Swarm agent load balancer. This information can be found in the Azure Portal.

## Deploy multiple containers

As multiple containers are started on the Docker Swarm cluster, the `docker ps` command can be used to see what host the containers are running on. In this example thee containers a spread evenly across the three Swarm agents.  


```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES
11be062ff602        yeasy/simple-web    "/bin/sh -c 'python i"   11 seconds ago      Up 10 seconds       10.0.0.6:83->80/tcp   swarm-agent-34A73819-2/clever_banach
1ff421554c50        yeasy/simple-web    "/bin/sh -c 'python i"   49 seconds ago      Up 48 seconds       10.0.0.4:82->80/tcp   swarm-agent-34A73819-0/stupefied_ride
4298d397b9ab        yeasy/simple-web    "/bin/sh -c 'python i"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        10.0.0.5:80->80/tcp   swarm-agent-34A73819-1/happy_allen
```  

## Deploy containers using Docker Compose

Docker compose can be used to automation the deployment and configuration of multiple containers. To so, ensure that an SSH tunnel has been created, and that the DOCKER_HOST variable has been set.

```bash
# set Docker host variable

export DOCKER_HOST=:2375
```

Create a docker-compose.yaml file on your local system. A sample can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgardler/AzureDevTestDeploy/master/docker-compose.yml).


```bash
web:
  image: adtd/web:0.1
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  links:
    - rest:rest-demo-azure.marathon.mesos
rest:
  image: adtd/rest:0.1
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"

```

Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the container deployments.


```bash
user@ubuntu:~/compose$ docker-compose up -d
Pulling rest (adtd/rest:0.1)...
swarm-agent-3B7093B8-0: Pulling adtd/rest:0.1... : downloaded
swarm-agent-3B7093B8-2: Pulling adtd/rest:0.1... : downloaded
swarm-agent-3B7093B8-3: Pulling adtd/rest:0.1... : downloaded
Creating compose_rest_1
Pulling web (adtd/web:0.1)...
swarm-agent-3B7093B8-3: Pulling adtd/web:0.1... : downloaded
swarm-agent-3B7093B8-0: Pulling adtd/web:0.1... : downloaded
swarm-agent-3B7093B8-2: Pulling adtd/web:0.1... : downloaded
Creating compose_web_1
```

Finally, the list of running containers can be returned, which will reflect those deployed with Docker Compose.


```bash
user@ubuntu:~/compose$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
caf185d221b7        adtd/web:0.1        "apache2-foreground"   2 minutes ago       Up About a minute   10.0.0.4:80->80/tcp       swarm-agent-3B7093B8-0/compose_web_1
040efc0ea937        adtd/rest:0.1       "catalina.sh run"      3 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        10.0.0.4:8080->8080/tcp   swarm-agent-3B7093B8-0/compose_rest_1
```
