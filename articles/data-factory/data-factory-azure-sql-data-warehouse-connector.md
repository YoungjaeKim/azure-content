# Move data to and from Azure SQL Data Warehouse using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how you can use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to move data from Azure SQL Data Warehouse to another data store and from another data store to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data sources and sinks for SQL Data Warehouse. 

The following sample(s) show how to copy data to and from Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** from any of sources to any of the sinks stated in the [Data Movement Activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) article using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

> [AZURE.NOTE] 
> For an overview of the Azure Data Factory service, see [Introduction to Azure Data Factory](data-factory-introduction.md). 
> 
> This article provides JSON examples but does not provide step-by-step instructions for creating a data factory. See [Tutorial: Copy data from Azure Blob to Azure SQL Database](data-factory-get-started.md) for a quick walkthrough with step-by-step instructions for using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory. 


## Sample: Copy data from Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Azure Blob

The sample below shows:

1. A linked service of type [AzureSqlDW](#azure-sql-data-warehouse-linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties). 
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureSqlDWTable](#azure-sql-data-warehouse-dataset-type-properties). 
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
4. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [SqlDWSource](#azure-sql-data-warehouse-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data belonging to a time series from a table in Azure SQL Data Warehouse database to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**Azure SQL Data Warehouse linked service:**

	{
	  "name": "AzureSqlDWLinkedService",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "AzureSqlDW",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "connectionString": "Server=tcp:<servername>.database.windows.net,1433;Database=<databasename>;User ID=<username>@<servername>;Password=<password>;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30"
	    }
	  }
	}

**Azure Blob storage linked service:**

	{
	  "name": "StorageLinkedService",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "AzureStorage",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
	    }
	  }
	}

**Azure SQL Data Warehouse input dataset:**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in Azure SQL Data Warehouse and it contains a column called “timestampcolumn” for time series data.
 
Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy informs the Data Factory service that the table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

	{
	  "name": "AzureSqlDWInput",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "AzureSqlDWTable",
	    "linkedServiceName": "AzureSqlDWLinkedService",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "tableName": "MyTable"
	    },
	    "external": true,
	    "availability": {
	      "frequency": "Hour",
	      "interval": 1
	    },
	    "policy": {
	      "externalData": {
	        "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
	        "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
	        "maximumRetry": 3
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

**Azure Blob output dataset:**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

	{
	  "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "AzureBlob",
	    "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
	      "partitionedBy": [
	        {
	          "name": "Year",
	          "value": {
	            "type": "DateTime",
	            "date": "SliceStart",
	            "format": "yyyy"
	          }
	        },
	        {
	          "name": "Month",
	          "value": {
	            "type": "DateTime",
	            "date": "SliceStart",
	            "format": "%M"
	          }
	        },
	        {
	          "name": "Day",
	          "value": {
	            "type": "DateTime",
	            "date": "SliceStart",
	            "format": "%d"
	          }
	        },
	        {
	          "name": "Hour",
	          "value": {
	            "type": "DateTime",
	            "date": "SliceStart",
	            "format": "%H"
	          }
	        }
	      ],
	      "format": {
	        "type": "TextFormat",
	        "columnDelimiter": "\t",
	        "rowDelimiter": "\n"
	      }
	    },
	    "availability": {
	      "frequency": "Hour",
	      "interval": 1
	    }
	  }
	}


**Pipeline with Copy activity:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **SqlDWSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **SqlReaderQuery** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

	{  
	    "name":"SamplePipeline",
	    "properties":{  
	    "start":"2014-06-01T18:00:00",
	    "end":"2014-06-01T19:00:00",
	    "description":"pipeline for copy activity",
	    "activities":[  
	      {

	        "inputs": [
	          {
	            "name": "AzureSqlDWInput"
	          }
	        ],
	        "outputs": [
	          {
	            "name": "AzureBlobOutput"
	          }
	        ],
	        "typeProperties": {
	          "source": {
	            "type": "SqlDWSource",
	            "sqlReaderQuery": "$$Text.Format('select * from MyTable where timestampcolumn >= \\'{0:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}\\' AND timestampcolumn < \\'{1:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}\\'', WindowStart, WindowEnd)"
	          },
	          "sink": {
	            "type": "BlobSink"
	          }
	        },
	       "scheduler": {
	          "frequency": "Hour",
	          "interval": 1
	        },
	        "policy": {
	          "concurrency": 1,
	          "executionPriorityOrder": "OldestFirst",
	          "retry": 0,
	          "timeout": "01:00:00"
	        }
	      }
	     ]
	   }
	}

> [AZURE.NOTE] In the above example, **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for the SqlDWSource. The Copy Activity runs this query against the Azure SQL Data Warehouse source to get the data.
>  
> Alternatively, you can specify a stored procedure by specifying the **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** (if the stored procedure takes parameters).
>  
> If you do not specify either sqlReaderQuery or sqlReaderStoredProcedureName, the columns defined in the structure section of the dataset JSON are used to build a query (select column1, column2 from mytable) to run against the Azure SQL Data Warehouse. If the dataset definition does not have the structure, all columns are selected from the table.

## Sample: Copy data from Azure Blob to Azure SQL Data Warehouse

The sample below shows:

1.	A linked service of type [AzureSqlDW](#azure-sql-data-warehouse-linked-service-properties).
2.	A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3.	An [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) dataset of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
4.	An [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) dataset of type [AzureSqlDWTable](#azure-sql-data-warehouse-dataset-type-properties).
4.	A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [BlobSource](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties) and [SqlDWSink](#azure-sql-data-warehouse-copy-activity-type-properties).


The sample copies data belonging to a time series from Azure blob to a table in Azure SQL Data Warehouse database every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples. 

**Azure SQL Data Warehouse linked service:**

	{
	  "name": "AzureSqlDWLinkedService",

	    }
	  }
	}

**Azure Blob storage linked service:**

	{
	  "name": "StorageLinkedService",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "AzureStorage",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
	    }
	  }
	}

**Azure Blob input dataset:**

Data is picked up from a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path and file name for the blob are dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, and day part of the start time and file name uses the hour part of the start time. “external”: “true” setting informs the Data Factory service that this table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

	}

**Azure SQL Data Warehouse output dataset:**

The sample copies data to a table named “MyTable” in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. You should create the table in Azure SQL Data Warehouse with the same number of columns as you expect the Blob CSV file to contain. New rows are added to the table every hour.

	      "frequency": "Hour",
	      "interval": 1
	    }
	  }
	}

**Pipeline with Copy Activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **BlobSource** and **sink** type is set to **SqlDWSink**.

See the [Load data with Azure Data Factory](../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-get-started-load-with-azure-data-factory.md) article in the Azure SQL Data Warehouse documentation for a walkthrough. 

## Azure SQL Data Warehouse linked service properties

The following table provides description for JSON elements specific to Azure SQL Data Warehouse linked service. 

Property | Description | Required
-------- | ----------- | --------
type | The type property must be set to: **AzureSqlDW** | Yes
**connectionString** | Specify information needed to connect to the Azure SQL Data Warehouse instance for the connectionString property. | Yes

Note: You need to configure [Azure SQL Database Firewall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee621782.aspx#ConnectingFromAzure). You need to configure the database server to [allow Azure Services to access the server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee621782.aspx#ConnectingFromAzure). Additionally, if you are copying data to Azure SQL Data Warehouse from outside Azure including from on-premises data sources with data factory gateway you need to configure appropriate IP address range for the machine that is sending data to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. 

## Azure SQL Data Warehouse dataset type properties

For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, please refer to the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...). 

The typeProperties section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The **typeProperties** section for the dataset of type **AzureSqlDWTable** has the following properties.

| Property | Description | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| tableName | Name of the table in the Azure SQL Data Warehouse database that the linked service refers to. | Yes |

## Azure SQL Data Warehouse copy activity type properties

For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, please refer to the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc are available for all types of activities.

**Note:** The Copy Activity takes only one input and produces only one output.

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

### SqlDWSource

In case of Copy activity when source is of type **SqlDWSource** the following properties are available in **typeProperties** section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| sqlReaderQuery | Use the custom query to read data. | SQL query string. For example: select * from MyTable. | No |
| sqlReaderStoredProcedureName | Name of the stored procedure that reads data from the source table. | Name of the stored procedure. | No |
| storedProcedureParameters | Parameters for the stored procedure. | Name/value pairs. Names and casing of parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. | No |

If the **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for the SqlDWSource, the Copy Activity runs this query against the Azure SQL Data Warehouse source to get the data. 

Alternatively, you can specify a stored procedure by specifying the **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** (if the stored procedure takes parameters). 

If you do not specify either sqlReaderQuery or sqlReaderStoredProcedureName, the columns defined in the structure section of the dataset JSON are used to build a query (select column1, column2 from mytable) to run against the Azure SQL Data Warehouse. If the dataset definition does not have the structure, all columns are selected from the table.

#### SqlDWSource example

    "source": {
        "type": "SqlDWSource",
        "sqlReaderStoredProcedureName": "CopyTestSrcStoredProcedureWithParameters",
        "storedProcedureParameters": {
            "stringData": { "value": "str3" },
            "id": { "value": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', SliceStart)", "type": "Int"}
        }
    }

**The stored procedure definition:** 

	CREATE PROCEDURE CopyTestSrcStoredProcedureWithParameters
	(
		@stringData varchar(20),
		@id int
	)
	AS
	SET NOCOUNT ON;
	BEGIN
	     select *
	     from dbo.UnitTestSrcTable
	     where dbo.UnitTestSrcTable.stringData != stringData
	    and dbo.UnitTestSrcTable.id != id
	END
	GO
 

### SqlDWSink
**SqlDWSink** supports the following properties:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| writeBatchSize | Inserts data into the SQL table when the buffer size reaches writeBatchSize | Integer. (unit = Row Count) | No (Default = 10000) |
| writeBatchTimeout | Wait time for the batch insert operation to complete before it times out. | (Unit = timespan) Example: “00:30:00” (30 minutes). | No | 
| sqlWriterCleanupScript | User specified query for Copy Activity to execute such that data of a specific slice will be cleaned up. See repeatability section below for more details. | A query statement.  | No |
| allowPolyBase | Indicates whether to use PolyBase (when applicable) instead of BULKINSERT mechanism to load data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse. <br/><br/>Note that only **Azure blob** dataset with **format** set to **TextFormat** as a source dataset is supported at this time and support for other source types will come shortly. <br/><br/>See [Use PolyBase to load data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse](#use-polybase-to-load-data-into-azure-sql-data-warehouse) section for constraints and details. | True <br/>False (default) | No |  
| polyBaseSettings | A group of properties that can be specified when the **allowPolybase** property is set to **true**. | &nbsp; | No |  
| rejectValue | Specifies the number or percentage of rows that can be rejected before the query fails. <br/><br/>Learn more about the PolyBase’s reject options in the **Arguments** section of [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn935021.aspx) topic. | 0 (default), 1, 2, … | No |  
| rejectType | Specifies whether the rejectValue option is specified as a literal value or a percentage. | Value (default), Percentage | No |   
| rejectSampleValue | Determines the number of rows to retrieve before the PolyBase recalculates the percentage of rejected rows. | 1, 2, … | Yes, if **rejectType** is **percentage** |  
| useTypeDefault | Specifies how to handle missing values in delimited text files when PolyBase retrieves data from the text file.<br/><br/>Learn more about this property from the Arguments section in [CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn935026.aspx). | True, False (default) | No | 


#### SqlDWSink example


    "sink": {
        "type": "SqlDWSink",
        "writeBatchSize": 1000000,
        "writeBatchTimeout": "00:05:00"
    }

## Use PolyBase to load data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse
**PolyBase** is an efficient way of loading large amount of data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Data Warehouse with high throughput.  You can see a large gain in the throughput by using PolyBase instead of the default BULKINSERT mechanism.   

If your source data store is not Azure Blob Storage, then you could consider copying the data from the source data store to Azure Blob Storage first as staging and then use PolyBase to load the data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse from the staging store. In this scenario, you will use two copy activities with first copy activity configured to copy data from source data store to Azure Blob Storage and the second copy activity to copy data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Data Warehouse using PolyBase. 

Set the **allowPolyBase** property to **true** as shown in the following example for Azure Data Factory to use PolyBase to copy data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. When you set allowPolyBase to true, you can specify PolyBase specific properties using the **polyBaseSettings** property group. see the [SqlDWSink](#SqlDWSink) section above for details about properties that you can use with polyBaseSettings.   


    "sink": {
        "type": "SqlDWSink",
		"allowPolyBase": true,
		"polyBaseSettings":

Azure Data Factory verifies whether the data fulfills the following requirements before using PolyBase to copy data to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. If the requirements are not met, it will automatically fall back to the BULKINSERT mechanism for the data movement.

1.	**Source linked service** is of type: **Azure Storage** and it is not configured to use SAS (Shared Access Signature) authentication. See [Azure Storage Linked Service](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service) for details.  
2. The **input dataset** is of type: **Azure Blob** and the type properties of dataset meet the following criteria: 
	1. **Type** must be **TextFormat**. 
	2. **rowDelimiter** must be **\n**. 
	3. **nullValue** is set to **empty string** (""). 
	4. **encodingName** is set to **utf-8**, which is **default** value, so do not set it to a different value. 
	5. **escapeChar** and **quoteChar** are not specified. 
	6. **Compression** is not **BZIP2**.
	 
			"typeProperties": {
				"folderPath": "<blobpath>",
				"format": {
					"type": "TextFormat",     
					"columnDelimiter": "<any delimiter>", 
					"rowDelimiter": "\n",       
					"nullValue": "",           
					"encodingName": "utf-8"    
				},
            	"compression": {  
                	"type": "GZip",  
	                "level": "Optimal"  
    	        }  
			},
3.	There is no **skipHeaderLineCount** setting under **BlobSource** for the Copy activity in the pipeline. 
4.	There is no **sliceIdentifierColumnName** setting under **SqlDWSink** for the Copy activity in the piepline. (PolyBase guarantees that all data is updated or nothing is updated in a single run. To achieve **repeatability**, you could use **sqlWriterCleanupScript**.
5.	There is no **columnMapping** being used in the associated in Copy activity. 

### Best practices when using PolyBase

#### Row size limitation
Polybase does not support rows of size greater than 32 KB. Attempting to load a table with rows larger than 32 KB would result in the following error: 

	Type=System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException,Message=107093;Row size exceeds the defined Maximum DMS row size: [35328 bytes] is larger than the limit of [32768 bytes],Source=.Net SqlClient

If you have source data with rows of size greater than 32 KB, you may want to split the source tables vertically into several small ones where the largest row size of each of them does not exceed the limit. The smaller tables can then be loaded using PolyBase and merged together in Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

#### tableName in Azure SQL Data Warehouse
The following table provides examples on how to specify the **tableName** property in dataset JSON for various combinations of schema and table name.

| DB Schema | Table name | tableName JSON property |
| --------- | -----------| ----------------------- | 
| dbo | MyTable	| MyTable  or  dbo.MyTable  or  [dbo].[MyTable] |
| dbo1 | MyTable | dbo1.MyTable  or  [dbo1].[MyTable] |
| dbo | My.Table | [My.Table] or [dbo].[My.Table] |
| dbo1 | My.Table | [dbo1].[My.Table] |

If you see an error as shown below, it could be an issue with the value you specified for the tableName property. See the table above for the correct way to specify values for the tableName JSON property.  

	Type=System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException,Message=Invalid object name 'stg.Account_test'.,Source=.Net SqlClient Data Provider

#### Columns with default values
Currently, PolyBase feature in Data Factory only accepts the same number of columns as in the target table. Say, you have a table with 4 columns and one of them is defined with a default value, the input data should still contain 4 columns. Providing a 3-column input dataset would yield an error as shown below:

	All columns of the table must be specified in the INSERT BULK statement.

NULL value is a special form of default value. If the column is nullable, the input data (in blob) for that column could be empty (cannot be missing from the input dataset). PolyBase will insert NULL for them in the Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  

#### Leveraging two stage copy in order to use PolyBase
PolyBase has limitations on the data stores and formats that it can operate with. If your scenario does not meet the requirements, you should leverage the Copy Activity to copy data to a data store supported by PolyBase and/or convert the data into a format that PolyBase supports. Here are examples of the transformations you can do:

-	Convert source files in other encodings to Azure blobs in UTF-8
-	Serialize data in SQL Server/Azure SQL Database into Azure blobs in CSV format.
-	Change the order of columns by specifying the columnMapping property.

Here are some tips when doing the transformations:

- Selecting an appropriate delimiter when converting tabular data into CSV files.

	It is recommended to use characters that are very unlikely to appear in the data as the column delimiter. Common delimiters include comma (,), tilde (~), pipe (|) and TAB(\t). If your data contains them, you can set column delimiter to be non-printable characters such as “\u0001”. Polybase accepts multi-char column delimiters which would allow you to construct more complex column delimiters.	
- Format of datetime objects

	When datetime objects are serialized, the Copy Activity, by default, uses the format: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fffffff", which is, by default, not supported by PolyBase. The supported datetime formats can be found here: [CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn935026.aspx). Failing to meet Polybase expectation on datetime format would result in an error as shown below:

		Query aborted-- the maximum reject threshold (0 rows) was reached while reading from an external source: 1 rows rejected out of total 1 rows processed.
		(/AccountDimension)Column ordinal: 97, Expected data type: DATETIME NOT NULL, Offending value: 2010-12-17 00:00:00.0000000  (Column Conversion Error), Error: Conversion failed when converting the NVARCHAR value '2010-12-17 00:00:00.0000000' to data type DATETIME.

	In order to resolve this error, specify the datetime format as shown in the following example:
	
		"structure": [
    		{ "name" : "column", "type" : "int", "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" }
		]

### Type mapping for Azure SQL Data Warehouse

As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data to & from Azure SQL, SQL server, Sybase the following mappings will be used from SQL type to .NET type and vice versa.

The mapping is same as the [SQL Server Data Type Mapping for ADO.NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc716729.aspx).
